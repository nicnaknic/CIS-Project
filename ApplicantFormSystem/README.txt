Due to the recent news of another form being added (A temp form for trades/labor work) I have
Decided to break the Temp form process up into 3 seperate Files. 

tmp1Form: Original temp applicant form, Includes fields for current employment, Type of work you are seeking, 
Area of expertise and proficiency in the following fields.

tmp2Form: WILL include the fields that are related specifically to trades/labor work as well as current employment 
and type of work you are seeking fields. 

tmp3Form: Final file for the Temp applicant system. Will include fields for "What is your work status", Current avaliability
Cities you are willing to work in, references as well as Upload fields for Resume and Cover letter

Since there are now two different temp forms that we will have to account for, the system will go:

basicForm -> tmp1Form (OR) tmp2Form -> tmp3Form -> (A page saying whether upload was successful or failed)
